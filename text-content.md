1 STAGES — CATEGORY PAGE
Hero
Nutrition designed for the stages of life.
 The body’s needs shift across different stages of life.
As life progresses, physiological needs, daily routines, and cognitive demands change.
 Stages is Blendence’s approach to designing nutrition around these real-life transitions — not trends, labels, or shortcuts.
 
What do we mean by “Stages”?
Life doesn’t change overnight, but it does change meaningfully.
At Blendence, we define stages through the intersection of three factors:
Physiological shifts
 Growth, development, and hormonal changes influence what the body needs over time.
Life context
 School, routines, learning, focus, stress, and responsibility reshape daily demands.
Nutritional design
 Nutrition should adapt to these conditions — thoughtfully and consistently.
Stages is not about categories.
 It’s about understanding when needs change — and designing nutrition accordingly.
 
Designed through a top-down approach
Stages blends are not built by assembling ingredients.
They are designed through a top-down nutritional engineering process:
1.	We first identify the typical needs of a specific life stage

2.	Nutritionists and food engineers work together to define a balanced formulation

3.	Ingredients are selected to support this structure — as part of a whole

The goal is not intensity or complexity, but relevance.
 
The first stages we designed for
The Stages system is designed to evolve.
 These blends represent the first applications of the Stages approach.
 
Early Growth (4–7)
KidGrow
A foundational stage marked by rapid physical development and habit formation.
KidGrow is optimized to support early growth years through a practical, balanced blend that fits naturally into everyday routines.
 
Learning & Energy (8–12)
KidRise
A transitional stage where school routines begin and daily demands increase.
KidRise is optimized for learning-intensive days, supporting steady energy and consistency throughout school-age routines.
 
Focus & Cognitive Load (13–16)
TeenFocus
A mentally demanding stage characterized by longer study periods and sustained attention.
TeenFocus is optimized for focus-intensive phases, supporting clarity and consistency during demanding school years.
 
Optimized — not restricted
Stages blends are optimized for specific life stages based on typical needs during those periods.
This does not limit who can use them.
 They are designed to be most relevant during certain stages of life.
 
Looking ahead
Stages will continue to evolve as new life stages emerge — from hormonal transitions to intense professional periods, from pregnancy to aging.
Understand the stage.
 Then design the nutrition.

 5 RESET — CATEGORY PAGE
Hero
Reset
Designed for moments when lightness and balance matter more.
Some periods feel heavier than usual.
 Meals, routines, or daily patterns may start to feel less balanced.
Reset is designed for those moments.
 
What Reset is about
Reset is not a life stage.
 It’s about moments when the body benefits from simplicity and lightness.
During certain periods, maintaining balance doesn’t require more intensity —
 it requires less load.
Reset blends are designed to support balance during these moments through clean, plant-based formulations that are easy to integrate into daily life.
 
When Reset becomes relevant
Reset is designed for periods when you prefer to lighten, not intensify, your daily intake.
It becomes relevant during moments such as:
●	when meals feel heavier than usual

●	when a lighter, plant-based option is preferred

●	when digestive comfort and simplicity become priorities

●	when maintaining balance matters more than stimulation

Reset supports balance during these moments —
 without pushing the body or adding unnecessary complexity.
 
What Reset supports
Reset blends are formulated to support:
●	fluid balance and digestive lightness, through their low energy density and plant-based composition

●	digestive-friendly routines, supported by dietary fiber

●	satiety and meal balance, as low-calorie, fiber-supported options

Reset does not aim to stimulate or cleanse.
 It supports balance by reducing unnecessary load, especially during periods when lightness matters.
 
Designed through formulation, not promises
Reset blends are not built around trends or extreme claims.
They are designed through a formulation-first approach:
●	plant-based ingredients

●	fiber-supported structure

●	low energy density

●	clean formulation mindset

The focus is not intensity, but relevance and balance.
 
Reset blends
Reset currently consists of two blends, designed for different degrees of demand.
Both follow the same formulation philosophy,
 but differ in concentration and usage context.
 
Reset Balance
Designed for periods where everyday routines continue,
 but a lighter, more balanced option is preferred.
Balance supports digestive comfort, fluid balance, and satiety
 as part of regular daily routines.
→ Explore Reset Balance
 
Reset Intense
Designed for moments when a more pronounced sense of lightness and balance is preferred.
Intense features a more concentrated formulation
 and is intended for intermittent use, rather than continuous routines.
→ Explore Reset Intense
 
Part of the Blendence system
Reset complements the Blendence framework:
●	Stages → nutrition designed around life stages

●	Reset → nutrition designed for moments of lightness and balance

●	Shield → nutrition designed for resilience during demanding periods

Different needs.
 Different moments.
 One consistent approach to nutritional design.
 
Closing
Reset doesn’t promise shortcuts.
 It supports balance — when the body benefits from feeling lighter.

 when a lighter feeling needs to be felt more clearly.
 
8 OUR APPROACH — PAGE
Hero
How we design nutrition.
At Blendence, we don’t start with ingredients.
 We start with needs.
 
Our way of thinking
Nutrition doesn’t work in isolation.
The body responds to combinations, context, and consistency.
That’s why every product begins with understanding:
●	who it’s for

●	when it’s most relevant

●	what the body typically needs during that period

 
A top-down design process
Blendence products are designed through a structured process:
1.	Define the context

2.	Identify typical needs

3.	Design the formulation

4.	Select ingredients that serve the whole

This ensures blends are designed, not assembled.
 
Technology as a tool
We use modern food technologies to support quality and consistency.
Technology supports the formulation — it does not define it.
 
Clean formulation mindset
●	No artificial colors

●	No artificial flavors

●	No unnecessary additives

Transparency and simplicity guide every formulation.
 
Designed for real life
Nutrition only works when it fits into daily routines.
Our blends are designed to be simple, practical, and consistent — supporting everyday use without complexity.
 
Closing
Designing nutrition is a responsibility.
 We take it seriously.
