Based on the visual descriptions in `content.md`, here are the recommended prompts for generating assets.

## 1. Hero Section (Video/GIF Loop)
**Concept:** A premium, fluid, and abstract introduction to the brand.
**Prompt:**
> Cinematic 8k 3d render of sleek nutraceutical product packaging floating in a serene, abstract environment. Soft, ethereal lighting with slow-moving liquid gradients in the background (pastel greens, soft oranges, calm blues). No humans, no laboratory settings. The transition between products is seamless and fluid, evoking a sense of balance and natural power. High-end commercial aesthetic, minimalist, clean, premium matte finish textures.

## 2. "Designed, Not Improvised" Section (Abstract Texture)
**Concept:** Represents the deliberate and scientific yet natural process.
**Prompt:**
> Macro photography of natural organic textures, abstract and clean. Intricate patterns of leaf veins or cellular structures, but stylized and artistic. Soft, neutral color palette (whites, greys, and subtle earth tones). High detail, depth of field, minimalist composition. No products visible, just pure texture representing "designed nature".

## 3. "Nutrition That Adapts" Section (Lifestyle/Abstract)
**Concept:** Evoking a sense of daily life and routine without showing specific people.
**Prompt:**
> A bright, airy modern interior space, kitchen or living area, slightly out of focus. A sense of morning light streaming through a window. In the foreground, a simple, elegant glass of water or a notebook on a table. Minimalist lifestyle photography, warm and inviting atmosphere. No human faces visible. Focus on the feeling of a calm, organized daily routine.

## 4. Stages Teaser (Metaphor)
**Concept:** illustrating growth and development stages (Seedling -> Sapling -> Tree) in a non-literal, artistic way.
**Prompt:**
> Artistic interpretation of growth stages. Three abstract forms arranged in a sequence: a small delicate sprout, a growing sapling, and a strong young tree. Rendered in a clean, modern, 3D illustrative style or high-end papercraft style. Soft lighting, growth gradation from left to right. Colors shifting from fresh light green, to vibrant green, to deep sturdy blue-green. Minimalist background.

## 5. Reset Spotlight (Product Mockup)
**Concept:** showcasing the Reset line with a focus on portability and unique packaging.
